# Invisible Defender - Server

We completed this project with my university classmate @electricalgorithm in 2021. But now I'm adding it to my github.

This repository made by İstanbul Üniversitesi-Cerrahpaşa Sustainable Energy Research Laboratuary BSc. Students. You must have server files (invisible defender server) in order to connect it from the application.
